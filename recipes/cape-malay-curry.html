    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This one pot of Cape Malay Chicken Curry will tickle your tastebuds with a unique mix of spices. It’s
        traditionally eaten without utensils (try using your hands – it’s fun!). This is a Proudly South African meal,
        hailing from the Southern-most tip of the country.</p>
    <p>Being so savoury and spicy, it would be a crime not to try out this meal. All you need is:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg chicken pieces (mix of thighs & drumsticks, skin on)</li>
        <li>250 g white onion (sliced)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>60 g fresh ginger (grated)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves (crushed)</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 tsp. chilli powder</li>
        <li>4 cardamom pods (lightly crushed)</li>
        <li>4 cloves</li>
        <li>2 sticks of cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt (more to taste)</li>
        <li>1.5 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>200 g tinned tomatoes (crushed)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 potatoes (peeled and cut into chunks)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch Oven over medium heat, add the vegetable oil followed by the sliced onions. Fry until they start
            to turn golden brown. Add the salt and sugar and stir through.</li>
        <li>Add the grated ginger and when it becomes fragrant, add the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>When you have a little colour on the chicken pieces add the garlic and cook for a minute before adding the
            spices. Stir the spices through until the aromas start to come forward.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock, stir through and cook covered for 40 minutes on a slow bubble. Add extra water if the
            stock reduces too far (it shouldn't).</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and tomato paste and stir through. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile boil the potatoes in salted water until cooked through.</li>
        <li>If the sauce has reduced too far with the curry, add extra water. Check for seasoning. It should be rich and
            flavourful.</li>
        <li>At this stage you can serve the curry with the potatoes, but traditionally it is left overnight to deepen
            the flavour of the curry. Either way, add the potatoes to the curry and gently stir.</li>
        <li>If eating the next day, allow the curry to cool a little before transferring to the fridge.</li>
        <li>Reheat the next day and serve with Cape Malay yellow rice.</li>
    </ol>
