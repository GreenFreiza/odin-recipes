    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you fancy making yourself a little treat, or starter to an amazing meal, try these tasty bacon wrapped onion
        rings. A twist on the traditional onion rings where we replace the breadcrumbs with juicy streaky bacon. A perfect
        snack to get those taste-buds going.</p>
    <p>It may not be a South African invention, but it's still staple of the
        nation nonetheless, and here's how you make it:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>12 strips bacon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Sauce of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. Line a medium baking sheet with aluminum foil and fit with a metal cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Cut onion into 1/2" rings, then separate every other ring, so that each ring contains two rounds of onion.</li>
        <li>Stir together brown sugar and cayenne pepper on a large shallow plate, then lay bacon on mixture to coat.</li>
        <li>Wrap doubled up rings with bacon, then set on baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until bacon is crisp and golden.</li>
        <li>Serve with sauce of your choice. (Yields 6 servings)</li>
    </ol>
