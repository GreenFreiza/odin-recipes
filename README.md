In this project I will be showcasing my knowledge of HTML so far and how that can be applied. 
I'm hoping that I will have learnt alot during the progression of this project as well as after it has been completed. 
Updates to follow.

Finally completed the project, i feel good about it since i did it without looking at any solutions.
Feeling pretty confident about my progress so far and i had fun doing it.
