    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <h2>One for the Taste Enthusiasts</h2>
    <p>In this first endeavour I bring you, <strong>Odin Recipes</strong>. This is a three-course meal themed after the
        richest and most fun country in Africa, South Africa.<em>(Opinion may be biased)</em></p>
    <p>Being such a diverse nation, there were many tasty and unique dishes to choose from, so I kept it very neutral
        with this three-course meal option:</p>
    <ul>
        <p><li>Delicious
            <a href="./recipes/bacon-rings.html"><strong>Bacon Rings</strong></a> as a starter,

        <p><li>The main dish being a savoury 
            <a href="./recipes/cape-malay-curry"><strong>Cape Malay Chicken Curry</strong></a> dish, and
            <img src="https://d3c699y7ogacoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/curry-chicken.jpg">

        <p><li>a sugary sweet
